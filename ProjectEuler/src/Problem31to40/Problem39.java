/**
 * TODO If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
 * sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
 * 
 * {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
 * 
 * For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
 * 
 * Solution : Looping through number from 5 to 1000 which represents the
 * perimeter. We denote the triangle numbers {a,b,c} such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 * and a < b < c. Then the upper bound of a is always c/3, because if a > c/3,
 * then c/3 < a < b < c, a+b+c will exceed the perimeter. And same goes with b,
 * b have to be smaller than c/2, if b > c/2, then c/2 < b < c, b+c will exceed
 * the perimeter. Loop from 1 to c/3 for a, from a + 1 to c/2 for b, and c =
 * perimeter - a - b. If a,b,c is right angle triangle numbers, then we add 1 to
 * counter. Finally return the perimeter with the most triangle numbers.
