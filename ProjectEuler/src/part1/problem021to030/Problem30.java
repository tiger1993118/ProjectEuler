/**
 * TODO Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum
 * of fourth powers of their digits:
 * 
 * 1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84 9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44 As
 * 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
 * 
 * The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 * 
 * Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
 * powers of their digits.
 * 
 * Solution : The trick part is to find the upper bound of the number we are
 * looking for, we denote the sum of fifth powers of their digits to be
 * sumOfDigits(), and notice that sumOfDigits(999999) = 354294 so that the
 * maximum sum of every 6 digits number is 354294, so the number above it will
 * have sum smaller than it. Now we have our upper bound, only thing we need to
 * do is write the algorithm to compute sum of fifth powers of their digits,
 * which is gonna be easy.
